### **Hi!**

I'm Ben, and I'm a sophomore at Brown University studying computer science. I am originally from Vancouver, Canada, and in my spare time, I blunder pieces on [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/ben-kang), (try to) hunt KOMs on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/87693504), and do a bit of [photography work](https://www.bj-photography.com/) on the side!
